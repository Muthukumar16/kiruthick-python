## Ethical Issues

- Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
- Plagiarism
- Digital Property Rights

## Intellectual Property Rights (IPR):

| S.No | IPR        | Details                                                                             |
|------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Copyright  | Right of the creator of the original creative work Ex: song, movie, software rights |
| 2    | Patents    | Right given to the inventor for their inventions, Ex: new manufacturing machines    |
| 3    | Trademark  | Registered Logo, shape, colors Ex: Google, Apple                                    |

#### Violation of IPR:

Three forms of IPR
1. [x] Plagiarism
2. [x] Copyright infringement
3. [x] Trademark infringement

#### Plagiarism:
Its stealing someone else's intellectual work and represent it as your own work without giving credit to creator

#### Copyright infringement

#### Trademark infringement

#### Digital Property Rights 
- Threats to Digital property
- Ex: Digital property / assets: `online personal account (email, social media accounts, photo, video, gaming accounts etc..), intellectual properties - music, software soruce codes etc...`
- Digital Property Rights protection
`Anti-Temper Solutions, Legal Clauses, Limit the sharing of software source code.`

## Open Source Philosophy and Software Licenses

#### Free Software
The Users freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software. And no payments are needed.
<br/> Below Definition of Free Software is published by `Richard Stallman's Free Software Foundation`
- <b>freedom 0:</b> To Run the program for any purpose
- <b>freedom 1:</b> Study how program works, adapt it to your needs (Pre-Condition: Access to source code)
- <b>freedom 2:</b> Redistribute copies to others (Adv. help your neighbor)
- <b>freedom 3:</b> Improve the software or source code and release improvements to public (Adv. whole community will benefits) 

#### Open source Software (OSS)
Can be freely used (modify) and source code freely available to customer, but does not have to be free of charge.
- OSS may receive payments for support, further development

###### Philosophy of Open Source:
- Free Redistribution
- Source code
- Derived works
- Author's source code (integrity)
- No Discrimination (Person or Groups)
- No Discrimination (Endeavour)
- License Distribution 
- License must not restrict
- License must be Technology Neutral

#### Definitions:
- OSS - Open Source Software (OSS) source code accessible, modifiable and redistributed without limitation, it may come free of cost however nominal charges applicable for development & support
- FLOSS - Free Libre/Livre and OSS - Free software and Open source software.
- GNU - GNU's Not Unix initiated by Richard M. Stallman objective to crate OS (Operating System) however Now, offers wide range of software.
- FSF - Free Software Foundation
- OSI - Open Source Initiative
- Freeware (Ex: Internet Explorer) - Available free of cost and which allows copy and re-distribute, but not for modification and whose source code is not available, distributed with binary form (ready to run) without any lic.
- Proprietary Software - Neither open nor freely available, Source code of proprietary software is normally not available
- Shareware - Right to distribute copies with specific period of time, then license should be paid
- Copylefted Software - Free software and generally disallow others to add additional requirements to the software and making source code available.

#### Licenses:
- Creative Common License (CCL): Offers `The CC Lic. give permission to copy, modify, distribute the original work with crator's permission. There are 6 different creator lic. (CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND, CC BY-BC-SA, CC BY-NC-ND) letters indicate conditions to use`
- GNU - GPL (General Public License): Offers `Software copy, distribute, charge a fee to distribute software, make whatever modification you want`
- Apache License: Offers: `Rights are worldwide, no fee or royalty, prpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable`

#### Public domain Vs Proprietary Software
- Public Domain - Free and can be used without restrictions, its outside scope of copyright and licensing.
- Proprietary Software - Which can neither free nor available for public. There is a proper license attached to it.

## Technology and Society
- Economic impacts - Adv: Globalisation of Goods and Services 
- Social impacts - Adv: Mass Market access 

#### Economic Benefits:
- Secure Transactions
- Ease and Availability
- Net Banking
- Global Market

## E-Waste Management
- Electronic waste, discarding electrical and electronic devices (ex; computer, TV, mobile, refrigerator etc.)
- Concern of discarding E-Waste: Careful about the data stored in discarded storage devices. Ex: Formate it or delete it using proper tools which can never be undeleted or unformatted later

#### E-Waste Disposal Process
- Dismantling
- Segregation of ferrous and non-ferrous metal and plastic
- Refurbishment and reuse
- Recycling/recovery of valuable material 
- Treatment/disposal of dangerous materials and waste: Ex: PCP (Printed Circuit board), Mercury (Hg) - Disposed off in underground landfill sites, Chlorofluoro-carbons (CFC) - treated thermally

#### Benefits of e-Waste Recycling
- Allow Recovery of valuable precious metals like copper, gold and zinc should be recycled
- Protects public health and water quality - Lead, Mercury and Cadmium E-wastes contains variety of toxic. When e-waste disposed into landfills it will have negative health and env. effects.
- Create Jobs - Domestically create new jobs for recyclers & refurbishers and create new market for valuable components that are dismantled. 
- Toxic Waste - Recycling this will help avoid human health risks (water contamination)
- Saves landfill space - Recycling this will help conserve landfill space.

## Gender Issues with Teaching/Using Computer
- 60-70 % are boys and rest girls in Computer Science in school level.

#### Under Representation
In India College level 17% girls represented in `Computer Science Engineering`
- Preconceived Notions. - Ex: Boys are better than girls, Girls keep in mind that they have raise family, Teaching is best option for girls, In India parents are playing important roles they are directly/indirectly push pre-conceived notions influencing girls
- Lack of Interest - Boys get to play more on computer/smartphone and develop more interest in computers than girls
- Lack of motivations - The `double-burden theory (family role and software carrer)` also discourage girls from technical subjects like Computer Science.
- Lack of Role models - Everywhere portrayed (TV, movies, etc) that is technical fields like Computer Science are mens fields. All these things psychologically they infer Computer science.
- Lack of Encouragement in class - Also some teachers pin point on their roles in society such `girls will get married and may not take it up as career` may play hindrance and girls do not develop as much as interest as they can in `Computer Science` Subject 

#### Possible solutions
- More initiatives and programs that encourage girls to take up Computer science subject
- The Film and TV censor board should ensure fair representation of female role models in TV, Cinema etc.
- In Practical rooms - Girls should encourage to work more on Computers. In Lap speak to Lab attendant to get all peripheral devices they want. They should encouraged to celebrate small success in the lab to big success (such as big success removed). This will give more confident

## Disability Issues while Teaching and using Computers
- Focus on `inclusive education` and promoting access for students with disabilities
- Computer science have made today's classroom really diverse and inclusive
- Other end many issues that have risen and those must to taken care of
- The Specially abled students, there can be one or more disabilities.
1) Locomotor disabilities - Polio, Leprosy, Cerebral palsy
2) Hearing and speech  - Hearing, Speech
3) Cognitive impairment - Specific learning deficits (Dyslexia, Dyscalculia), Down's syndrome, Autism
4) Vision impairment - low vision, blindness

#### Unavailability of Teaching materials
- Different type of disabilities needs different type of aids/materials.
- Ex: Vision impairment -> Needs different type of screen readers, Hearing impairment -> Need more of visual input than oratory instruction should be available sign language
- Ex: Locomotor impairment -> Keyboard and Mouse for disabled need visual keyboards 1) Sophisticated virtual keyboard software 2) Joystick 3) Virtual keyboard without mouse
- Ex: Low Vision -> Braille Keyboards, Monitors and Printers along with screen reader.

#### Lack of Special Needs Teachers
- Different types of special needs, if special needs teachers are available, disabled students get their needs addressed in right manner.
- For Hearing impaired students - sign language would able to convey and explain the study materials
- Teachers who should know Special type of Specialized Hardwares: `Braille Keyboards, Monitors, Printers, Synthetic speech generators, software assistants such as Google assistant etc.`
- Voice Assistants: `Microsoft's Narrator and Cortana and Ubuntu's Orca and onBoard`
- `Special version of Linux called BLinux for especially meant for the blind`
- `Software with accessibility features of various Office Softwares - Microsoft Office and open source offerings such as Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice`
- `Specialized editor for visually impaired sutdents for typing program`

#### Lack of Supporting Curriculum
- Curriculum should be designed while keeping inclusive education
- Always keep in mind for special needs of the students.
- Software program should be used for specially needs Ex: Office softwares easily be implemented for all types of students
- Programming Language with specialized editors are also available ex: Scratch, the block based programming language should not be included
- Programming contests should be conducted all types of students

#### Possible Solutions:
- School must work toward availability of required teaching aids/materials, proper budget should be allocated for buying required equipments to promote inclusive education
- School must employee special needs teachers and also train other teachers
- School must support `inclusive` curriculum and refrain from any other practice that directly or indirectly puts the disabled students at the disadvantage side.
