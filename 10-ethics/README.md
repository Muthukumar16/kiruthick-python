<br/> Below Definition of Free Software is published by `Richard Stallman's Free Software Foundation`
- <b>freedom 0:</b> To Run the program for any purpose
- <b>freedom 1:</b> Study how program works, adapt it to your needs (Pre-Condition: Access to source code)
- <b>freedom 2:</b> Redistribute copies to others (Adv. help your neighbor)
- <b>freedom 3:</b> Improve the software or source code and release improvements to public (Adv. whole community will benefits) 

#### Open source Software (OSS)
Can be freely used (modify) and source code freely available to customer, but does not have to be free of charge.
- OSS may receive payments for support, further development

###### Philosophy of Open Source:
- Free Redistribution
- Source code
- Derived works
- Author's source code (integrity)
- No Discrimination (Person or Groups)
- No Discrimination (Endeavour)
- License Distribution 
- License must not restrict
- License must be Technology Neutral

#### Definitions:
- OSS - Open Source Software (OSS) source code accessible, modifiable and redistributed without limitation, it may come free of cost however nominal charges applicable for development & support
- FLOSS - Free Libre/Livre and OSS - Free software and Open source software.
- GNU - GNU's Not Unix initiated by Richard M. Stallman objective to crate OS (Operating System) however Now, offers wide range of software.
- FSF - Free Software Foundation
- OSI - Open Source Initiative
- Freeware (Ex: Internet Explorer) - Available free of cost and which allows copy and re-distribute, but not for modification and whose source code is not available, distributed with binary form (ready to run) without any lic.
- Proprietary Software - Neither open nor freely available, Source code of proprietary software is normally not available
- Shareware - Right to distribute copies with specific period of time, then license should be paid
